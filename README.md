# Spring Boot CRUD Application

This is a simple Spring Boot application that performs basic CRUD operations on a `User` entity using a MySQL database.

## Project Structure

- `User`: Entity class representing a user with fields `username`, `password`, and `active`.
- `UserRepository`: Repository interface extending `JpaRepository` to interact with the database.
- `UserService`: Service class containing the business logic for CRUD operations.
- `UserController`: REST controller to expose CRUD operations via HTTP endpoints.



This README file provides a clear overview of the project, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and testing guidelines. Feel free to customize it based on your specific project needs!
